# 100-days-of-code-in-Python

Welcome to my 100-day bootcamp Python repository! This is my journey while taking the course of 100 days of code in Python on Udemy platform. 
 This repository contains the code and notes from my journey to becoming a Python developer.

Overview
This bootcamp was designed to help me gain a deep understanding of the Python programming language and its various applications. It covers a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, web development, and machine learning.

Throughout the bootcamp, I faced many challenges and learned a lot about Python and software development in general. I hope that my notes and code will be helpful to others who are interested in learning Python and becoming a Python developer.

Repository contents
This repository contains the following directories and files:

**code**: This directory contains the code that I wrote throughout the bootcamp, organized by topic. Each subdirectory contains code for a specific topic or project.

**notes**: This directory contains my notes from each day of the bootcamp, organized by topic. Each file contains notes for a specific topic or project.

**readme.md**: This file contains an overview of the repository and its contents. ***To help illustrate the function of the code, I included a gif created with LICEcap. This gif provides a visual representation of how the code operates, allowing you to easily understand its behavior by simply watching it.***

Challenges
Throughout the bootcamp, I faced a number of challenges that helped me to improve my skills and understanding of Python. Some of the challenges that I faced included:

Understanding complex data structures and algorithms: Some of the topics covered in the bootcamp, such as trees and graphs, were new to me and required a lot of practice to understand.

Debugging code: As I learned more about Python and started writing more complex programs, I encountered more bugs and had to spend more time debugging my code. "Thonny" application helped a lot!

Working with web development frameworks: Learning to use web development frameworks like Django and Flask was a challenging but rewarding experience.

Despite these challenges, I was able to persevere and learn a lot about Python and software development. I hope that my notes and code will be helpful to others who are embarking on a similar journey.
