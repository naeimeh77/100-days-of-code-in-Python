# Day 6 - Python Functions and Karel the robot
I was supposed to write the code that's required to instruct a little robot(Karel) to be able to complete any randomly generated maze. 
The platform was reeborg.ca

## Exercise
We exercised a couple of reeborg.ca maze scenarios. Please see the cool gif below for the final maze version.
